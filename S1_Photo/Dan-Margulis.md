# About the Author & His Books
>Dan Margulis was one of the first three individuals—and the only writer—to be named as a member of the Photoshop Hall of Fame. In announcing his election, the National Association of Photoshop Professionals said, “Dan’s ability to reduce complicated concepts to words that users can understand and his insistence on dealing with real-world relevance have made him today’s most influential voice in color reproduction.” Dan’s 2006 best-seller, Photoshop LAB Color, revolutionized workflows. Channels expert David Biedny called Photoshop LAB Color “probably the most important Photoshop book ever written.”
>Dan Margulis is considered the world's leading authority on digital color correction. In 2001, he was one of the first three people, and the only educator, named to the Photoshop Hall of Fame.

We have been confused if Dan Margulis's books really put into "Photoshop Retouch Sacred" like them published in Chinese version?

## Meta Question
+ Who write the book?
>Dan Margulis write the book, and three other persons code the "PPW" panel.

+ Who will be the reader?
>+ Man with

+ Why & When the author write the book? ( In another way **--->** At which situation bring the book born? )
>In the early time of digital camera, computer is slowly and expensive, so, retouch workflow just exist in high-end market. And now, the work have fall into normally, time is one of the most important restrictions.

+ Where is the materials resource of the book?
>The course

+ Where to find **_Additions_**?
>1. The **_Homepage_** of the book: <http://www.moderncolorworkflow.com/>.
>2. The **_PPW_** panel docs ( the **_PPW_** itself can download from homepage mentions above).
>3. The **_PPW_** in Ledet Website: <http://www.ledet.com/margulis/ppw>

+ What is the book **_major focus in_** and what is the book **_apply to_**?
>The book is focus in how to quickly make picture beauty with automation ( in 1~5 minutes with the _PPW_ panel ).
>The book is focus in **_Global Retouch_**, not **_Local Retouch_**.

>The book's **_Theory_** is apply to every picture, but **_PPW_** itself is best apply to these picture
>- Picture with full _Depth Of Field_.
>- Landscape, Postcard ( Means the human is **_Not the Subject_** in picture,in other word, **_PPW_** is not doing well in **_Portrait_**)

+ How the book is construct?
>The book
>Each chapter divide into **_Two Part_**:
>- First Part: Talking about **_How to Use_**
>- Second Part: Talking about **_Why to Use_** or **_Advanced Usage_**

## Opinion Abstracted and Outline
1. The **_First_** is **_which_** effect you want, the **_Second_** is **_How_** to reach ( or **_What_** to do ). Many **_Amateurs_** know the **_First_** and unkonw the **_Second_**. Many **_Experts_** are the opposed.
2. Some **_Evaluations_** of picture quality are **_Subjective_**, but some are **_Objective_**, it is **_Important_** to **_Distinguish_** them.
	1. If all audiences unlike a effect, it is **_Objective_**.
	2. If only some audiences unlike a effect, it is **_Subjective_**.
3. All retouch methods are focus in extract **_Detail_** ( means **_Luminocity Information_** ) and make **_colorful_** (means **_Color Information_**) . Retouch can abstract as a **_Workflow_** and then divide into **_3 Main Steps_** **--->** **_Color - Luminocity - Color_**

## Generally Retouch Workflow
One retouch job can be comprehended as a **"Retouch Workflow"**, and this workflow can be divide into some levels:

1. _**Workflow Node**_:
2. _**Workflow Goal**_: The _**Workflow Goal**_ is an **abstract** level which means you can not
3. _**Workflow Action**_: "Action" here is similar to PS's "Action". Both "Action" here and PS's "Action" is consist of some command, but "Action" here is a abstract conception which means "Action" here is beyond PS's "Action"

## PPW Workflow
PPW's **"Decompositio Philosophy"** is process _**"Luminosity"**_ and _**"Color"**_ **separately** mostly through the time.


1. **_Color Initalize_**: in _`RGB`_ mode
    1. Color Correction：Make **_Supposed to Be Gray_** color be **_Gray_** or **_Obviously Wrong_** color fall into **_Right Value Range_**
        - `Curve Adjustment Layer` in _`RGB`_ mode **--->** CH3
		- **_Complementary Color_** **--->** CH9
    4. Color Range Define
        - Define **"Black Point"** and **"White Point"** in _`RGB`_ mode **--->** CH3\&CH4
2. **_Luminosity Allocate_**: in _`RGB`_ mode
    1. Luminosity Reallocation:
        - Luminosity layer by `Channel Mix` (`Apply Image` or `Calculation`) **--->** CH4
		- Luminosity Curve by `Curve Adjustment Layer`
    3. Contrast Boost:
        - Luminosity Curve by `Curve Adjustment Layer` **--->** CH4
    5. Extract Detail from **_Shadow & Highlight_**
        - PS `Shadows/Hightlights`
		- PPW `S/H+OK` **--->** CH7
        - PPW `Bigger Hammer` **--->** CH10
    7. Strengthen Specific Things
        - PPW `Darken Sky SC` and `Darken Sky B` **--->** CH8
    8. Extend Luminocity Range
        - `Screen` and `Multiply` **--->** CH12
3. **_Color Artistic_**: in _`LAB`_ mode
    1. ??
        - PPW `H-K` **--->** CH13
    5. Skin Color Retouch
		- PPW `Skin Desaturation` **--->** CH9
    7. Color Boost
        - PPW `CB` **--->** CH5
        - PPW `MMM` **--->** CH6
    10. Define Color **"Black Point"** and **"White Point"**
        - ?? **--->** ALL-CH?
	11. Define Luminocity **"Black Point"** and **"White Point"**
		- Curve end-points by `Curve Adjustment Layer` in _`LAB`_ mode ( **_"L"_** channel ) 
    11. Color ease
        - PS **_"Mark"_** **--->** ALL-CH?
        - PS **_"Opacity"_** **--->** ALL-CH?
4. **_Sharpen_** ( **_Optional_** ):
	1. Sharpen
		- PS `USM Sharpen`
		- PS `Smart Sharpen`
		- PPW `sharpen 2015`
		- PPW `Sharpen old`
5. **_Ending_** ( **_Optional_** ):
    1. Versions Blending: Versions blending maybe better than one version with long time retouch.
        - Layer blending mode **--->** CH2
		- Layer opacity
		- Layer blend if
		- Layer mask[^mask-with-opacity]: In **_Spatial_** reveal some part of one version the other part of other versions.
    8. Color Space match
        - Color transfer
[^mask-with-opacity]: Actually, you should know mask will contain **_Opacity_** effect.

## PPW Action
1. CB："Color Boost"
    1. Input：Color balance and non color shift globally
    2. Process：`Curve Adjustment Layer` in _`LAB`_ mode
    2. Output：
2. H-K:
    3. Input：
    4. Process：
    5. Output：Darken **"Neutral"** or **"Near Neutral"** Color between 1/4 and middle color tone.
6. RGB Curve[^not-in-lab]：
    1. Input：Image with color shift which at least has one characters list below: ( The right color value can see the [Reference Standard Color Values](#reference-standard-color-values) )
        1. Neutral color in nature. example: gray wall.
        2. Impossible or ugly color in nature. example: sky with red color

[^not-in-lab]: Color correction in _`RGB`_ mode
