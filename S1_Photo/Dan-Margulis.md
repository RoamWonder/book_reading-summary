# About the Author & His Books
>- Dan Margulis was one of the first three individuals—and the only writer—to be named as a member of the Photoshop Hall of Fame. In announcing his election, the National Association of Photoshop Professionals said, “Dan’s ability to reduce complicated concepts to words that users can understand and his insistence on dealing with real-world relevance have made him today’s most influential voice in color reproduction.” Dan’s 2006 best-seller, Photoshop LAB Color, revolutionized workflows. Channels expert David Biedny called Photoshop LAB Color “probably the most important Photoshop book ever written.”
>- Dan Margulis is considered the world's leading authority on digital color correction. In 2001, he was one of the first three people, and the only educator, named to the Photoshop Hall of Fame.

Dan Margulis has published **Three Serials** books: **_"Professional Photoshop"_**, **_"Photoshop LAB Color"_** and **_"Modern Photoshop Color Workflow"_**.

We have been confused if Dan Margulis's the **Three Serials** books really put into **One "Photoshop Retouch Sacred Serial"** ( “Photoshop修色圣典”系列 ) like them published in Chinese version?

# Modern Photoshop Color Workflow: The Quartertone Quandary, the PPW, and Other Ideas for Speedy Image Enhancement
## Review by RoamWonder
**_Recommendation_**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🌟

**_Review_**:
- **Dan Margulis's Books** are **Very Profound** and **Hard to Read**. If you decide to read, please be sure you have **Enough Time** and **Enough Patience**, them will **At Least** need you **A Second Read**.
- The Book look like **_Integrated Apply_** with two other books ( "Professional Photoshop" & " Photoshop LAB Color" ), if you like **_RoamWonder_**, who read two other books and **_Unknow How To Use_** these technologies, maybe you should read the book and then **_Go Back to Read_** two other books. **_RoamWonder_** are so happy the author had published the book, otherwise, there will be long long time to understand two other books.
- The Book had taught us **_A More Scientific Retouch Workflow_** than before and it is **_Easy to Learn_**.
- **_RoamWonder_** are not very agree with the author when he talking about "ACR".

+ Who will be the reader?
>+ Man with

+ Why & When the author write the book? ( In another way **--->** At which situation bring the book born? )
>In the early time of digital camera, computer is slowly and expensive, so, retouch workflow just exist in high-end market. And now, the work have fall into normally, time is one of the most important restrictions.

+ Where is the materials resource of the book?
>The course

+ Where to find **_Additions_**?
>1. The **_Homepage_** of the book: <http://www.moderncolorworkflow.com/>.
>2. The **_PPW_** panel docs ( the **_PPW Itself & Docs_** can be downloaded from homepage mentions above ).
>3. The **_PPW_** in Ledet Website: <http://www.ledet.com/margulis/ppw>

+ What is the book **_major focus in_** and what is the book **_apply to_**?
>1. The book is focus in how to quickly make picture beauty with automation ( in **_Average Three Minutes_** with the **_PPW_** panel ).
>2. The book is focus in **_Global Retouch_**, not **_Local Retouch_**.
>3. The book's **_Theory_** is apply to every picture, but **_PPW_** itself is best apply to these picture.
>>	1. Picture with **_full Depth Of Field_**.
>>	2. Landscape, Postcard ( Means the human is **_Not the Subject_** in picture,in other word, **_PPW_** is not doing well in **_Portrait_**)

+ How the book is construct?
>1. The book
>2. Each chapter divide into **_Two Part_**:
>>1. First Part: Talking about **_How to Use_**
>>2. Second Part: Talking about **_Why to Use_** or **_Advanced Usage_**

## Opinion Abstracted and Outline
1. The **_First_** is **_which_** effect you want, the **_Second_** is **_How_** to reach ( or **_What_** to do ). Many **_Amateurs_** know the **_First_** and unkonw the **_Second_**. Many **_Experts_** are the opposed.
2. Some **_Evaluations_** of picture quality are **_Subjective_**, but some are **_Objective_**, it is **_Important_** to **_Distinguish_** them.
	1. If all audiences unlike a effect, it is **_Objective_**.
	2. If only some audiences unlike a effect, it is **_Subjective_**.
3. All retouch methods are focus in extract **_Detail_** ( means **_Luminocity Information_** ) and make **_colorful_** (means **_Color Information_**) . Retouch can abstract as a **_Workflow_** and then divide into **_3 Main Steps_** **--->** **_Color - Luminocity - Color_**.
4. If you want retouch in **_Less Than One Minute_**, Just do **_Color Initalize_** and maybe **_Sharpen_**.
5. If you have **_More Than Three Minutes_** and want get **_A Better Result_**, can do it in two different ways:
	1. Retouch **_Very Carefully and Precise_**, but maybe **_Not Very Different_**.
	2. Retouch and get **_Several Versions_** and then **_Bleeding_**.
6. Some **_"Obviously Error"_** would destory **_Entire_** picture feeling.
7. If there is **_Chromatic Aberration_**, Make sure it is **_Warn Color_** ( **_Yellow_** will **_Better_** than **_Red_**) .
8. Values are **_More Credible_** than **_Eyes_**

## Generally Retouch Workflow
One retouch job can be comprehended as a **"Retouch Workflow"**, and this workflow can be divide into some levels:

1. _**Workflow Node**_:
2. _**Workflow Goal**_: The _**Workflow Goal**_ is an **abstract** level which means you can not
3. _**Workflow Action**_: "Action" here is similar to PS's "Action". Both "Action" here and PS's "Action" is consist of some command, but "Action" here is a abstract conception which means "Action" here is beyond PS's "Action"

## PPW Workflow
PPW's **"Decomposition Philosophy"** is process _**"Luminosity"**_ and _**"Color"**_ **separately** through the time.

1. **_Color Initalize_**: **_Mostly_** in _`RGB`_ mode, **_"10 Seconds Detect and All in 1 Minute"_** 
    1. **Color Correction** ：Make **_"Supposed to Be Neutral"_** color be **_"Neutral"_** or **"_Supposed to Be Near-Neutral"_** to be **_"More Near-Neutral"_** or **_"Obviously Out of Range"_** color fall into **_Right Range_** ( See more in [Reference Color Values](#reference-color-values) below )
        - `Curve Adjustment Layer` in _`RGB`_ mode[^color-correct-in-rgb] **--->** CH3
			1. Make Three or Four **Reference Points** ( distribute from most light to most dark )
			2. Add and Adjust `Curve Adjustment Layer` make these **Reference Points** to right ( Adjust in _`RGB`_ mode and evaluate with _`LAB`_ value )
			3. Change the `Curve Adjustment Layer`'s **Bleeding Mode** from **_Normal_** to **_Color_**
		- **_Complementary Color_** **--->** CH9
    4. Color Range Define
        - Define **"Black Point"** and **"White Point"** in _`RGB`_ mode **--->** CH3\&CH4
2. **_Luminosity Allocate_**: **_Mostly_** in _`RGB`_ mode
    1. Luminosity Reallocation:
        - Luminosity layer by `Channel Mix` (`Apply Image` or `Calculation`) **--->** CH4
			1. `Duplicate` Layer and name it like **Layer_lum**
			2. `Apply Image` to **Layer_lum** with **Good Luminosity Contrast Channel** in **_Normal_**
			3. Adjust **Each Channel** in **Layer_lum**
			4. Change the Layer's **Bleeding Mode** of **Layer_lum** from **_Normal_** to **_Luminocity_**
		- Luminosity Curve by `Curve Adjustment Layer`
    3. Contrast Boost:
        - Luminosity Curve by `Curve Adjustment Layer` **--->** CH4
    5. Extract Detail from **_Shadow & Highlight_**
        - PS `Shadows/Hightlights`
		- PPW `S/H+OK` **--->** CH7
        - PPW `Bigger Hammer` **--->** CH10
    7. Strengthen Specific Things
        - PPW `Darken Sky SC` and `Darken Sky B` **--->** CH8
    8. Extend Luminocity Range
        - `Screen` and `Multiply` **--->** CH12
3. **_Color Artistic_**: **_Mostly_** in _`LAB`_ mode
    1. **_Neutral Color_**:
        - PPW `H-K` **--->** CH13
    5. **_Skin Color Beautified_**
		- PPW `Skin Desaturation` **--->** CH9
    7. **_Color Boost_**
        - PPW `CB` **--->** CH5
        - PPW `MMM` **--->** CH6
    10. Define Color **"Black Point"** and **"White Point"**
        - ?? **--->** ALL-CH?
	11. Define Luminocity **"Black Point"** and **"White Point"**
		- Curve end-points by `Curve Adjustment Layer` in _`LAB`_ mode ( **_"L"_** channel )
    11. Color ease
        - PS **_"Mark"_** **--->** ALL-CH?
        - PS **_"Opacity"_** **--->** ALL-CH?
4. **_Sharpen_** ( **_Optional_** ):
	1. Sharpen
		- PS `USM Sharpen`
		- PS `Smart Sharpen`
		- PPW `sharpen 2015`
		- PPW `Sharpen old`
5. **_Ending_** ( **_Optional_** ):
    1. Versions Blending: Versions blending maybe better than one version with long time retouch.
        - **_"Layer Blending Mode"_** **--->** CH2
		- **_"Global Layer Opacity"_**
			- `Opacity`:
			- `Blend If`:
		- **_"Local Layer Opacity"_**
			- `Layer Mask`: In **_Spatial_** reveal some part of one version the other part of other versions.
    8. Color Space match
        - Color transfer

[^color-correct-in-rgb]: Color correction **Adjust** in _`LAB`_ mode is not very **_Stable_** ( Little adjust may result heavy effort ), **But** should **Evaluate** with _`LAB`_ value ( in _`RGB`_ or _`CMYK`_ mode it has no rule to indicate whether a **_Non-Neutral_** color is right or wrong )

## PPW Action
1. CB："Color Boost"
    1. Input：Color balance and non color shift globally
    2. Process：`Curve Adjustment Layer` in _`LAB`_ mode
    2. Output：
2. H-K:
    3. Input：
    4. Process：
    5. Output：Darken **"Neutral"** or **"Near Neutral"** Color between 1/4 and middle color tone.

# Reference Color Values
**X** means can be any value.

|Name|Describe|Value Range|
|--|--|--|
|Skin Tone| **_"A"_** and **_"B"_** both are **_Positive_**, and **_"B"_** will be a little bigger than **_"A"_** ||
|Green Plant| **_"A"_** is **_Negative_**, **_"B"_** is **_Positive_**, and the **_"Absolute Value"_** of **_"B"_** would be fall into \[1.5, 2.5\] times **_"A"_** | |
